# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- Visual perception
- Speech recognition
- Decision-making
- Language translation
- Problem-solving

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing systems that can learn and improve from experience. Instead of explicitly programming rules, machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to enable computers to "learn" from data.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). It has revolutionized fields such as:

- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Autonomous Vehicles
